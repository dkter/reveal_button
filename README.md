reveal_button
==

A cool HTML5 button attempting to mimic Windows's Fluent Design buttons.


Disclaimer
--

I made this as a fun project that looks cool, but the performance of CSS
gradients isn't nearly as polished as whatever Windows uses for compositing.
This will kill laptop batteries and run slowly on older computers and mobile
devices. **It should not be used in any normal website.** If you don't believe
me, open up a CPU graph and run your cursor over the buttons.

I probably shouldn't have to say this, but web devs will always be web devs.


Usage
--

First of all, please don't.

But if you really have to:

* Include the `reveal/reveal.js` and `reveal/reveal.css` files in your
`<head>`.
* Create a reveal button with `<button class="reveal">`.
